    # attributes. A small query language is supported within this:
    #
    # Operator | Action
    # -------- | ------
    # `+`      | Matches both terms
    # `|`      | Matches either terms
    # `-`      | Negates a single token
    # `"`      | Wraps tokens to form a phrase
    # `(`  `)` | Provides precedence
    # `~N`     | Specifies edit distance (fuzziness) after a word
    # `~N`     | Specifies slop amount (deviation) after a phrase
    #
    # Up to *limit* zones will be returned, with a paging based on *offset*.
    #
    # Results my also also be limited to those associated with specific *tags*.
